# CIO Brief: Gavin's MSTR March Pump Thesis & CIO Assessment
**Date:** 2026-02-25 | **Source:** #mstr-gavin session | **Status:** Hypothesis Under Evaluation

---

## Gavin's Thesis

**Claim:** MSTR pumps to $150-200, beginning between March 2-23, 2026.
**Conditional:** If $135 resistance breaks to the upside → proceed to $167-200 within a month.

### Multi-Timeframe SRI Evidence (Gavin's Charts)

**Chart 1 — Very Long TF (2D, SRIBI only):**
- Descending channel from ATH ($540) with lower boundary ~$103-110, upper ~$175-180
- SRIBI has flipped green (positive) after prolonged red/yellow — early bullish bias shift
- Bottoming depth mirrors 2022 cycle (though shallower on SRIBI magnitude)
- Yellow ascending trendline support converging near $119-120
- Channel break projected in the March 2-23 window if price holds current levels

**Chart 2 — Short TF (8h SRI):**
- Advanced cupping: red/pink support line has carved clear U-shape, bottoming at ~$87-92 in Feb, now rising to ~$110-115
- Fast TL cupped up to ~$128-130 (at price), approaching Slow TL at ~$133-135
- Slow TL remains resistance — no evidence of being turned into support yet
- Initial target: $135-140 (Slow TL test)

**Chart 3 — Long TF (1D SRI):**
- Fast TL acting as support at ~$124-125
- Robust fit line descending from above, now converging at ~$118-122 (flattening)
- Rising pink cup pushing up from below at ~$124-125
- **Squeeze forming:** Three lines compressing into $118-130 band — imminent directional resolution
- If upward: target ~$167 (orange resistance band area)

**Chart 4 — Very Long TF (2D SRI):**
- Fast TL horizontal resistance at ~$129-135
- Advanced cupping visible in line formations
- Slow TL at ~$190-200 (declining)
- Orange resistance stepped down to ~$190-200

**Gavin's Conclusion:** $135 is the key level. If broken to the upside → $167-200 within a month.

## CIO Assessment

### Supportive Evidence

| Factor | Detail | Weight |
|---|---|---|
| Multi-TF alignment | Short, Long, VL all show compression/cupping pointing to same 2-4 week window | High |
| Short TF cupping confirmed | Red support line U-shape from $87→$115, Fast TL approaching Slow TL | High |
| Long TF squeeze legitimate | Price compressed between Fast TL support, robust fit, and rising cup at $118-130 | High |
| $135 as multi-TF gate | Resistance on Short (Slow TL), Long (squeeze boundary), VL (Fast TL) | High |
| Credit instruments healthy | STRC $99.91, STRF $99.84 — both near par, funding machine intact | High |
| Options max pain above price | Mar 6: $140, Mar 13: $150, Mar 20: $140, Mar 27: $150 vs price $124.61 | Medium |
| CME shorts massive | LF net: -20,047 contracts — squeeze fuel | Medium-High |
| MVRV 0.50 (deep discount) | Spring loaded — Stage 1 must begin from MVRV < 1.0 | Medium |
| SRI 20-day transition prob 60% | Window ends ~Mar 15-19 | Medium |
| FOMC March 17-18 | Potential dovish catalyst aligns with timing | Medium |
| MSTR/BTC/STRC ratio cup & handle | Handle consolidating at 0.19, structural bottom intact | Medium |

### Unsupportive Evidence

| Factor | Detail | Weight |
|---|---|---|
| GLI Z-score -1.01 | Global liquidity contracting — dampens all bullish calls 20% per meta-filter | **Critical** |
| VL (2D SRI) deeply bearish | Red Slow TL in freefall from $340→$34. VL overrides shorter TFs for trend | High |
| SRIBI -49.86 on Long TF | No zero-cross yet — momentum not confirming | High |
| BTC derivatives crowded long | OKX L/S ratio 2.17, long-flush risk before rally | Medium-High |
| STRK at $78.23 (-22% to par) | Equity market NOT pricing in recovery to $200 | Medium-High |
| No confirmed catalyst for $135 break | Technical compression doesn't predetermine direction | Medium |
| GEGI -0.67 | Global expansion gauge negative | Medium |
| BTC needs ~$90K+ for MSTR $200 | Requires macro participation, not just technical | Medium |
| Wide target range ($150-200 = 33%) | Lower end more defensible than upper end | Methodological |

### Probability Matrix

| Target | By 3/23 | By 4/23 | Requirement |
|---|---|---|---|
| **$135** (break resistance) | **45-50%** | 55-60% | Squeeze resolution upward + any catalyst |
| **$150** (Short TF target) | **25-30%** | 40-45% | $135 break + momentum continuation |
| **$167** (Long TF target) | **15-20%** | 25-30% | $135 break + BTC >$75K + SRIBI zero-cross |
| **$200** (VL Slow TL) | **5-10%** | 15-20% | Stage transition + GLI turn + BTC >$90K |

**Conditional: IF $135 breaks with volume → $167-200 within a month: 35-45%**

### BTC Price Implications

| MSTR Target | Required BTC (at mNAV ~1.2-1.3x) |
|---|---|
| $150 | ~$73-75K |
| $167 | ~$81-83K |
| $200 | ~$90-95K |

BTC currently at $66.4K. The $73-75K for MSTR $150 is plausible via CME short-covering. The $90K+ for MSTR $200 requires macro liquidity participation.

## Method Critique

### Strengths
- Multi-timeframe discipline — Short/Long/VL agreement, not single-chart
- Conditional framing — "if $135 breaks, then..." is proper hypothesis construction
- Cupping recognition — red support U-shapes correctly identified as basing signals
- Key level convergence — $135 confirmed across three timeframes

### Gaps to Address
- No macro integration (GLI/GEGI absent from the analysis)
- No preferred stock confirmation layer (STRC/STRF/STRK not referenced)
- VL bearish contradiction not explicitly resolved — why are shorter TFs right and VL wrong?
- Target range too wide — $155-167 is the best-supported zone, $200 is aspirational

## Triggers to Watch (Bullish Confirmation)

1. **MSTR closes above $135 with volume >2x ADV** — the gate opens
2. **STRK reclaims $85** — equity market pricing in recovery
3. **SRIBI crosses zero on Long TF** — momentum confirms
4. **GLI Z-score improves above -0.7** — macro headwind easing
5. **BTC breaks $72K** — validates the BTC price path needed for MSTR targets

**Two of five = move from "plausible" to "probable"**

## Triggers to Watch (Bearish Invalidation)

1. **MSTR breaks below $118** (Long TF squeeze resolves downward)
2. **STRC drops below $97** (credit stress, funding mechanism impaired)
3. **BTC breaks $58K** (below Feb 5-6 Bottom 1A, pattern failure)
4. **STRK makes new low below $71.40** (equity capitulation round 2)
