# Top 3 Options Recommendations — Feb 24, 2026
**As of 1:28 PM ET | MSTR $124.17 | BTC $64,293**
**IV30: 80.6% (83rd pctile) | Slope pctile: 98.8 (extreme put skew) | Stage 4 Day 187**

---

## Context
BTC dropped 7% overnight (Feb 23-24) from $67.8K to $62.5K low, recovering to ~$64.3K. MSTR from $131 Friday close to ~$124. Put skew at 98th percentile = extreme fear pricing on downside. Preferred stock spread (STRF/STRC) NOT confirming weakness = bullish divergence per Gavin's signal layer. All three recs use April 17 expiry (52 DTE) to give room in this volatility regime.

## 🥇 #1: Iron Condor — Apr 17 $105/$95P + $145/$155C

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **Credit** | $4.63 mid / $4,630 per 10-lot |
| **Max risk** | ~$5,370 per 10-lot |
| **R/R** | ~89.8% |
| **Profitable range** | ~$100 - $150 (±16% from spot) |
| **DTE** | 52 days |
| **Put wing OTM** | 15% below spot |
| **Call wing OTM** | 17.4% above spot |

**Thesis:** Best R/R on the board. 98th percentile put skew means outsized premium on the put side. $40 profitable range accommodates current volatility. Put wing below the Feb 5-6 capitulation low ($100 area). Call wing above declining resistance and all MAs.

**Kill condition:** MSTR breaks $108 or $142 with volume. STRC below $97 = close put side.

- Kill: MSTR < $108 or > $142 with volume → close immediately
- STRC < $97 → close put side regardless

## 🥈 #2: Bull Put Spread — Apr 17 $110/$100P

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **Credit** | $2.90 mid / $2,900 per 10-lot |
| **Max risk** | $7,100 per 10-lot |
| **R/R** | 40.8% |
| **OTM** | 10.9% below spot |
| **DTE** | 52 days |

**Thesis:** Pure "credit is healthy" play. Gavin's preferred signal layer: STRF above par, STRC near par — credit markets NOT confirming BTC weakness. $110 short strike is below Feb 5-6 capitulation low on MSTR (~$112). Betting MSTR doesn't make new lows in 52 days while collecting fat premium from extreme skew.

**Kill condition:** MSTR breaks $112 with volume >2.5x ADV, or STRC breaks below $97.

**Execution:** Sell 10x Apr 17 $110P, Buy 10x Apr 17 $100P. Limit $2.75+ net credit.

## 🥉 #3: Bear Call Spread — Apr 17 $145/$155C

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **Credit** | $2.28 mid / $2,280 per 10-lot |
| **Max risk** | $7,720 per 10-lot |
| **R/R** | 29.5% |
| **OTM** | 17.4% above spot |
| **DTE** | 52 days |

**Thesis:** Death cross active, all MAs declining, GLI Z-score -1.01, Stage 4 Day 187. MSTR reaching $145 requires BTC at ~$80K — a 25% rally against every macro signal. Slow TL at $143.74 declining ~$0.88/day. High probability of max profit.

**Kill condition:** MSTR reclaims $137 (SMA20) with 3 consecutive closes above.

**Execution:** Sell 10x Apr 17 $145C, Buy 10x Apr 17 $155C. Limit $2.15+ net credit.
